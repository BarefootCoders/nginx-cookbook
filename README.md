Installs nginx from package OR source code and sets up configuration
handling similar to Debian's Apache2 scripts.

## Requires
* apt (for nginx::source)
* build-essential (for nginx::source)

## Platform
Debian or Ubuntu though may work where 'build-essential' works, but other
platforms are untested.

## Apps
Take this SSL-only app being served by rainbows (perfect for evented Ruby
apps):

```ruby
:nginx => {
  :apps => {
    :myapp_ssl => {
      :server_port => 443,
      :server_name => "myapp.domain.com myapp.domain.com.local",
      :public_path => "/home/myapp/app/public",
      :custom_location_directives => [
        "proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;"
      ],
      :upstream_servers => [
        "unix:/home/myapp/app/tmp/web.sock max_fails=2 fail_timeout=5s",
        "127.0.0.1:8080 fail_timeout=5s backup"
      ],
      :custom_directives => [
        "ssl on;",
        "ssl_certificate /var/certs/myapp.crt;",
        "ssl_certificate_key /var/certs/myapp.key;",
        "ssl_session_timeout 5m;"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

We are using both a UNIX socket for the upstream (significantly quicker
than a TCP one), and we're defining a backup TCP socket, just in case
our UNIX one fails. We're also denifing some custom directives for this
app's server block. [More nginx load balancing and reverse proxying tips] [1].
